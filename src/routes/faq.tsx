  { q: "How do I pay?", a: "After checkout you'll receive an Order ID and our bank account details. Transfer the exact amount using the Order ID as the reference, then upload your receipt to our Customer Care Representative via WhatsApp." },
  { q: "Can I return a pair?", a: "Unworn pairs in original packaging can be exchanged within 7 days. See our Shipping & Returns page for details." },
  { q: "What if my size sells out?", a: "Contact our Customer Care Representative via WhatsApp — we may be able to restock or suggest a comparable pair." },
  { q: "How do I track my order?", a: "Use the Track Order page and enter your Order ID (e.g. SL-XXXXXX)." },
